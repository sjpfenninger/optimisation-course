# `optimisation-course`: SEN1511 Engineering Optimization and Integrating Renewables in Electricity Markets

Materials for the TU Delft COSeM MSc course [SEN1511](https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_searchCtrl.do?course_code=sen1511&surname=&item_value=&onlyElectives=Y&tag_id=&deleteTag_id=&operation=searchOnCode).

## Run notebooks online

This is the easiest option if you do not want to set up Python on your own computer or to work in a computer room.

You will work in a temporary session in your web browser. You can either run the notebooks on Binder or on Google Colab. Try both and see which you prefer. Google Colab requires you to be logged in with your Google Account but has the advantage that you can easily save modified copies of the notebooks to your account.
