    "Negative prices are a price signal on the power wholesale market that occurs when a high inflexible power generation meets low demand. Inflexible power sources can’t be shut down and restarted in a quick and cost-efficient manner. Renewables do count in, as they are dependent on external factors (wind, sun).On wholesale markets, electricity prices are driven by supply and demand, which in turn are determined by several factors such as climate conditions, seasonal factors or consumption behavior. This helps to maintain the required balance. Prices fall with low demand, signaling generators to reduce output to avoid overloading the grid. On the Day-Ahead and Intraday markets of EPEX SPOT, they can thus fall below zero.In some circumstances, one may rely on these negative prices to deal with a sudden oversupply of energy and to send appropriate market signals to reduce production. In this case, producers have to compare their costs of stopping and restarting their plants with the costs of selling their energy at a negative price (which means paying instead of receiving money). If their production means are flexible enough, they will stop producing for this period of time which will prevent or buffer the negative price on the wholesalemarket and ease the tension on the grid.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)**  \n",
    "Negative prices are not a theoretical concept. Buyers are actually getting money and electricity from sellers. However,you need to keep in mind that if a producer is willing to accept negative prices, this means it is less expensive for him to keep their power plants online than to shut them down and restart them later.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)**  \n",
    "Negative pricesare a comparably rare phenomenon, as several factors have to happen at the same time. However, they are nothing unusual. In Germany, where inflexible power generation from renewables is increasing, 211 hours on 39 days with negative prices were observed on the Day-Ahead market in 2019. On the Intraday market there were 241 hours with negative prices on 44 days in the same year. If these markets were not coupled, negative prices would occur more often, and price peaks would be more acute.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)**  \n",
    "Liquidity –based on wide offer and demand –is key for lowering the occurrence of negative prices. This is where cross-border trading solutions come in. On the Day-Ahead market, Market Coupling provides a solution for the optimal use of cross-border capacities between two or more markets. Thanks to the Market Coupling in North-Western Europe (including France, Germany, Benelux, Great Britain, the Nordic and Baltic countries), negative prices are buffered orprevented. For instance, in the case of low or negative prices in Germany, France and Benelux, Denmark and Sweden will import electricity until the cross-border capacity is fully used or prices converge.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  On the Intraday market, the trading system M7 can optimally use cross-border capacities and hence buffer volatility, which also helps to decrease the number of negative prices. As a result, the “quality” of negative prices both on the Intraday and the Day-Ahead markets today is different to the extent that they did not reach -1500 € as in 2009 before the integration process took off.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(e)**  \n",
    "Prices on the wholesale markets reflect market fundamentals and the evolution of supply and demand. Power Exchanges likeEPEX SPOT provide a transparent and secure price signal to the actors of the wholesale markets. Itdepends on the suppliers on the question if low or negative wholesale prices have an impact on prices for final consumers."
