    "I recommend spending 2-3 hours going through [QuantEcon: Python Programming for Economics and Finance](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html). In particular, their chapters \"1. About Python\" through \"6. OOP I: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming\" (leaving out chapter 7, which goes into more detail on object-oriented programming); then, all chapters from 8 onwards which give an overview of Python's most important scientific packages.\n",

    "Some points to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We are working in notebooks. The notebook consists of cells. Some cells - like the one you are looking at right now - contain text. Others, further below, contain code. Cells with code can be executed: while your cursor is inside the cell, press `Shift + Return`.\n",
    "* Assign something to a variable with \"=\", e.g.: `x = 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Within the notebook environment, just executing a command will show you the results: writing `1 + 1` in a cell and executing that cell will print `2`. Writing `x` in a cell will print `1` (if the variable x was previously assigned as above).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Careful: whitespace has meaning in Python - it is used to structure the code into separate logical blocks. For example, to delineate what code is inside an if-block (in this example y only becomes 2 if x > 1, whereas z = 3 is outside the if-block and always executed):\n",
    "```\n",
    "if x > 1:\n",
    "    y = 2\n",
    "z = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this course you can get away with using Python in a basic way more like a scientific calculator. However, some minimal use of control statements (especially \"for\" loops) will make some steps quicker and easier to do – we will try to explain what is happening when making use of such statements."
